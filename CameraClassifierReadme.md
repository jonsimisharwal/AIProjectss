üì∏ Camera Classifier
A machine learning project that classifies images based on the type of camera used ‚Äî such as DSLR, smartphone, webcam, etc. This can be useful in digital forensics, photo sorting, or understanding camera usage patterns.

üöÄ Features
Classifies camera types from image data

Preprocessing pipeline for image metadata and visual content

Trained model using [insert model type: CNN, SVM, etc.]

REST API for prediction

Web interface to upload and classify images (optional)

üß† Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries: TensorFlow / PyTorch, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas

üèÅ Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies

Sample
Input:
   enter the first class
   enter the second class
   then give image on camera and click on that image class also
   then train model
Output:
  predict model
