# 💡 Daily AI Projects – Learn, Build, Repeat! 🚀

Welcome to my **AI Projects Hub**! I'm on a mission to **upload small AI-based projects daily** as I learn and explore the vast world of Artificial Intelligence using **Python** and its powerful libraries.

## 📅 Daily Uploads
Every day, I’ll be working on a mini project that focuses on:
- 📚 Learning a new AI/ML library or concept
- 🔨 Applying it in a hands-on mini project
- 🧠 Strengthening my understanding by building, not just reading!

---

## 🔍 What to Expect
- ✅ Simple, beginner-friendly AI projects
- 🐍 Python-based implementations
- ⚙️ Libraries: `NumPy`, `Pandas`, `Scikit-Learn`, `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `OpenCV`, `NLTK`, `SpaCy`, and more!
- 📂 Well-structured code with explanations
- 📝 Learning notes and key takeaways with each project

## 🌟 Why This Repo?
I believe in **learning by doing**. This repo is my AI learning diary — one project a day, one step closer to mastery.

If you're learning AI too, feel free to follow along, fork, or contribute! 💬
